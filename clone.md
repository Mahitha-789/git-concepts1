#clone
==>Clone is used to make a complete copy of an existing repository to our local repository.
Includes downloading the entire project files so we can work on it locally.

Use of git clone
==>Get all files & history. Once cloned, you can work without internet later, we can sync.

Example:
==>When we are joing a new team or a new project we need that project locally then we use clone to get all files from git repo so we can work on that.

Steps:
Copy the repo URL and we will give some commands in terminal to clone a project "git clone URL" to change directory "cd foldername" and run "git remote -v" to see the origin. To verify we can check through "git status" command.
