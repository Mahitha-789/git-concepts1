#merge
==> git merge is used to combine changes from one branch into another.
It takes the commits from a source branch and integrates them into the target branch.

Use of merge:
==> To bring together work from different branches into one branch.
==> Commonly used to combine a other branch into the main branch after development.

Example:
==> If we create a branch called feature-login and completed the login feature, we can merge it into the main branch so that the main project includes the new feature.
